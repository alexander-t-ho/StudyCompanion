# Use this file to configure the cron jobs with whenever gem
# Learn more: http://github.com/javan/whenever

# Example schedule (uncomment and configure as needed):
# every 1.day, at: '2:00 am' do
#   runner "DailyMetricsCalculationJob.perform_later"
# end

# For now, we'll use Sidekiq's scheduled jobs instead
# This file can be used with the 'whenever' gem if you prefer cron-based scheduling
