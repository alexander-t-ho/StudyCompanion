**Meeting records** Recording

**Summary**

The team reviewed the current sprint's progress, identifying a critical blocker related to an external API for the payment gateway. A plan was formulated to mitigate the blocker with mock data while the issue is escalated. The team also aligned on tasks and priorities for the upcoming sprint, focusing on completing the user authentication flow and responsive UI components.

**Details**

**Sprint Progress Review: Bob's Update**
Alice Johnson started the meeting by asking Bob for an update on his tasks. Bob Smith explained that he has completed approximately 80% of the backend logic for the new user authentication module. He stated that the core functionality is in place, but he has encountered a significant blocker preventing him from finalizing the integration with the payment gateway.

**Blocker Discussion: Payment Gateway API**
Bob Smith detailed the blocker he's facing. He discussed that the external payment gateway's API endpoint for creating a new customer subscription is not behaving as documented. While the API documentation specifies a certain JSON response structure, the live test endpoint is returning a different, incomplete structure, which is breaking his data validation and processing logic. Alice Johnson asked if he had reached out to their support team. Bob confirmed he sent a detailed email with request/response logs to the vendor's technical support yesterday morning but has not yet received a reply beyond an automated acknowledgment.

Carol Williams asked if it was possible for Bob to create a mock API endpoint or a static mock data file that returns the expected response. She suggested this would allow him to complete his module's logic and would also unblock her, as she needs to integrate the frontend components with a working authentication flow. Bob Smith agreed that this was a viable workaround and that he could get a mock service running by the end of the day.

Alice Johnson decided to escalate the API issue to ensure it doesn't delay the project timeline further. She stated she has a direct contact for their account manager at the payment gateway company and will call them immediately after the standup to get an expedited response from their engineering team.

**Sprint Progress Review: Carol's Update**
Carol Williams discussed her progress on the frontend tasks. She reported that the new dashboard UI components are fully developed and have been tested for cross-browser compatibility. The code has been committed to the 'feature/dashboard-redesign' branch. She has now started working on the subsequent task of making the entire dashboard layout fully responsive for mobile and tablet views. Carol asked Bob about the timeline for the authentication module, as she needs to integrate the "user profile" dropdown and "logout" functionality, which depend on the user's logged-in state. Bob Smith confirmed that once he implements the mock data workaround, the authentication flow will be testable, and she can connect to it.

**Next Sprint Planning & Project Milestones**
Alice Johnson transitioned the discussion to planning for the next sprint. She reviewed the project milestones, highlighting that the next major deliverable is a fully functional end-to-end user registration and login flow, including the initial subscription setup.

Based on the current progress and the discussed blocker, Alice proposed the following key tasks for the upcoming sprint:
*   **Bob:** Finalize and test the payment gateway integration (contingent on the vendor fixing the API issue). In parallel, support Carol with the auth integration using the mock service.
*   **Carol:** Complete the responsive UI for all dashboard pages and integrate the user profile and authentication components with the backend.
*   **Team:** Schedule a joint integration testing session for the end of the sprint to validate the complete user registration-to-dashboard workflow.

Bob Smith and Carol Williams both agreed with the proposed plan and confirmed the workload seemed manageable. Alice Johnson concluded the section by stating she would create the user stories and tasks in the project management tool and assign them out following the meeting.

**Suggested next steps**

*   **Alice Johnson** will contact the payment gateway account manager to escalate the API endpoint issue.
*   **Bob Smith** will create a mock API response for the payment gateway to unblock his development and Carol's frontend integration.
*   **Alice Johnson** will create and assign the new sprint tasks in the project management tool for Bob and Carol.
